# Greasy Scripts
<b><i>Greasy Scripts</i></b> allows you to search for user scripts available for the site you're just visiting with a single click. You can also choose to be automatically notified whenever scripts are available for a page.

Currently <i>Greasy Scripts</i> searches the popular scripts repository <a href="https://greasyfork.org/"><b>Greasy Fork</b></a>. More repositories are likely to be added in future.

<i>Greasy Scripts</i> integrates nicely with <a href"https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/greasemonkey/"><b>Greasemonkey</b></a> and <a href"https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/scriptish/"><b>Scriptish</b></a> if you have either of them installed, but you can also use it on its own.


With this functionality <i>Greasy Scripts</i> fills the gap that was left when the former number one page "userscripts.org" went off-line for good and the add-on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/greasefire/">Greasfire</a> (which had a similar feature set but was limited to that page) became obsolete.
